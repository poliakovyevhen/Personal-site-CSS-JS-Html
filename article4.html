						<h2>How to improve your conversational skills?</h2>
						<p>
						Communication - is what governs our world. And it is also one of the most important skills which need to own.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Follow body language
						</h3>
						<p>
						Says the source that happy to see him and crossed his arms? Or say that the listen to it carefully and stuck on the phone? If this is you, then you should definitely do your body language. Our gestures influence on the conversation in the same way or even more than words. Learn to manage your gestures.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Get rid of the word-parasites
						</h3>
						<p>
						"Aaaaa," "mmm" - not the best word to carry on a conversation. You try to use them to get rid of uncomfortable pauses, but do worse. Start tracking these words to get rid of them once and for all. These pauses are much less visible than you think.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Prepare some topics for conversation
						</h3>
						<p>
						Situations where you need to turn over a few words with the man often encountered. And well, if you are sociable by nature and do not suffer from isolation. If the topic for conversation come up hard, use the following topics for conversation: family, profession, the entertainment hobby and exactly dreams.
						</p>
						<p>
						These topics form the method FORD (family, occupation, recreation, dreams). Ask interlocutor about it, and your little conversation turn into an interesting conversation.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Tell the story
						</h3>
						<p>
						That just does not say that you have a boring life and no interesting story. Sometimes the stories that we already seem familiar, can cause a sensation.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Do not be afraid to ask questions
						</h3>
						<p>
						Ask interlocutor about his plans for the summer, about the work, about children. Finally, put yourself in his place and think about what questions you would like to hear. Invented? Feel free to ask. Also, do not be afraid to ask again if no heard something. This is much better than saying "uh huh" and then realize that you are asked about your favorite movie.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Do not get distracted
						</h3>
						<p>
						We know how you love your smartphone, but do not let it know about your companion. I think that there is nothing worse when during your companion story looks at smartphone. Once again, put yourself in the other person and understand that the smartphone will wait.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Remember about your audience
						</h3>
						<p>
						The audience may be different. This may be your employees at work, your child's friends from kindergarten or friends at a party. One thing is certain: the style of your speech should be different in all three cases. You will not wield difficult words to convey their messages to children. And also will not grimace and entertain their employees at work. Choose a style that is suitable for your audience.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Clearly expressed
						</h3>
						<p>
						Do not pour excess water during the conversation. At this point you need to know when to stop. On the one hand, epithets, descriptions and different metaphors can decorate your language and make it interesting. On the other hand, excessive detail will make your conversation muddy and unclear interlocutor. So be as clear, accurate and concise.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Empathize and put yourself on place of conversation
						</h3>
						<p>
						If you try to put yourself on place of interlocutor, then advance to say that you understand how to behave in an interview. This technique makes the conversation more relaxed and removes the inconvenience that often occurs when your point of view converge.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Listen
						</h3>
						<p>
						Most importantly it can be anything. Listen, really listen - not the easiest task, but the effort spent on its development, will pay off.
