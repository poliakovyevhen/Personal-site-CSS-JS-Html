						<h3>Why is self-development and personal growth important?</h3>
						<p>
							In childhood, we are actively taught and developed all kinds of schools, sports sections, circles and "life experiences of parents." However, once a person grows out of all this, he begins to feel complete freedom from those shackles in which he was hidden for many years.
						</p>
						<p>
							But time passes, and we understand that something is wrong. Despite the fact that you have studied and received some knowledge for so long, you are missing them. It is not a question of complex theorems that you have not mastered within the walls of a school or institute. The fact is that the surrounding world is not stationary, it constantly changes any processes. This can not but affect your own feelings of this life. At some point, you begin to realize that the freedom that was so sweet in the beginning oppresses you. You do not know what to talk about with others, where to go to rest, than to occupy yourself on the weekend. You become bored and uninteresting to live.
						</p>
						<p>
						This is a very common problem among those who have stopped in their development, namely, they stopped applying any efforts for self-development. After all, a person who is in constant search of something, a priori, can not look bored. He always has something to ponder over, and what to dream about, but these feelings are far from boredom and dreary loneliness. The spiritual degree of a person's growing up depends on how adequately and constructively he can perceive this world.
						</p>
						<p>
						In order to achieve a harmonious existence of a person within society, it is necessary to constantly make efforts for self-development and personal growth. This allows you to see the world in a different light. The surrounding events no longer seem frightening and disgusting, the topics for interesting and informative conversations are themselves, there is no excessive shyness, lack of self-confidence. Through self-development, you can find a path to yourself. This becomes a very important condition for finding a place in the modern world.
						</p>
						<p>
						Understand yourself - understand the world!
