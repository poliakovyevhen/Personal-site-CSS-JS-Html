						<h2>Ignore other people's thoughts - obey your dreams</h2>
						<p>
						If you care what you think about other people, it will destroy all your brightest dreams. It will destroy your ability to implement breakthrough ideas. This surely undermine your ability to market their services. This will destroy the strength of powerful marketing words. If you care what other people think about you in the long run it will destroy you.
						</p>
						<p>
						The problem with other people's ideas is that usually people are not so informed. People around you, even if they genuinely care about you, do not know what you think and where you go as good as you.
						</p>
						<p>
						They watch what you do from afar. They sometimes hear about your plans. They are guess about your motives of what you are, in their view, do. To change this, to really change what they think other people will need an enormous amount of your energy.
						</p>
						<p>
						After all, it does not matter. If you win, it is not because all around you think you should win more often. If you get more lucrative contracts, is not that your boss or your buyer thinks you deserve to get more contracts. No one will give you concessions at their own expense just because you look like a man who deserves to her luck.
						</p>
						<p>
						No, people do not think and do not act. Usually people around you act for their own purposes. You are interesting, but they much more interested in themselves. Just as they are programmed. And you too. Therefore bustle and attempts to attract to their side those who distracts you - a waste of time. This does not mean that you have to behave like a bastard. But this does not give you reason to spend time full of nonsense.
						</p>
						<p>
						That is why the fight for own dream - most importantly, than you need to do now. Do not try to conquer friends. Do not try to convince people that what you are doing - wise. Do not bend under the pressure of others. Stand up straight. Fighting for themselves. Dart away for a goal, not taking from her sight.
						</p>
						<p>
						There will always be people who envy you. There will always be people who disagree with your style. Even your best friends will find flaws in your actions and attitudes. Why waste your time on breaks rather than to seek approval.
						</p>
						<p>
						Lets you have own dreams - but not dreams that you should, in the opinion of others. Proceed gently but firmly. Do not look back. Keep in mind that what you want to come. Time to change those who have doubts. And if not - you will have all the same.
