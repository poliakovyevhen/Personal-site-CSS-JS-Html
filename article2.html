						<h2>How to understand introvert?</h2>
						<p>
						Writer and introvert<strong> Merien Reid </strong> is confident that the world ща extroverts has a distorted view of "a people". So she made a list of<strong> 15 items</strong> that will help better understand the action of introverts.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>1. Your birthday does not bring us pleasure</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						Any introvert, who works in the office feel embarrassment when all haste begin to resemble someone for a gift. Not because we feel sorry for the money, No. Just any random employee who happily tells us that it is a holiday, leads us into a state of stupor. It seems as if he expects us without measure enthusiastic reactions of enthusiasm and interest. Maybe - horrors! - we even get from him an invitation to a party of three hundred strangers. Well let three hundred - is an exaggeration, but it seems this pattern introvert who most want to go home. Therefore, if you do not invite us, we do not оffended. We just sigh with relief.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>2. Please forget about our birthday</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						Oh really, leave. We have several close friends, whose greeting for us enough. We do not want noisy celebrate and have fun. The best holiday for us - calm and quiet, in a circle of carefully selected people. The world should not know anything about it.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>3. We do not actually listening how you spent your weekend</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						If you do not belong to our circle of friends, we do not care how was your Saturday. We truly believe that everyone has the right to privacy, and if you spend your time on loud parties or breaking door by your old girlfriend, it is your right. We do not condemn - just chat with someone whom we do not know, takes too much energy. Just that we work together does not mean that we really know each other.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>4. We hate the crowds</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						We are tired of large groups of people. We intoxicating variety of types and social groups. Some introverts are empatycs because they tend to easily fall under the influence of a foreign power. Sometimes we think that we "feel" everyone in the room and get this emotional overload.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>5. We do not really like corporate events</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						This is especially difficult for introverts who manage the business. The need for team work makes us do things which takes us out of balance. Each time spoken word, listen to each point of view - it is a struggle for us. Even in business, we need to feel connected with someone on a different level to get the most out of corporate events. You need a lot of time to organize teamwork or any event with many participants that all feel as comfortable as possible.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>6. We pretend that we like you </strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						Yes, it's true vile. We perfectly know who we like and who is not. This may be due to many reasons: from older children to failed breakfast this morning. Do not take it personally. The trouble is that honesty, as if we do not appreciate, sometimes causing pain. To survive, we must oust all these emotions and be good, but it is much harder than being genuine.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>7. We can work</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						When we are alone, we spend time on the project activities, emails, drafts and inventing options capture the world. We have many ideas. We appreciate loneliness, because it allows us to experiment with concepts and give will to imagination. Everything is possible when we are alone, and that we make may one day change our lives - and your too.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>8. We like written communication</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						We love emails because it gives us the opportunity to obtain the necessary without personal contact. Live interaction knocked us off course and we have to spend a lot of energy to come back to your wave. So please call us only when it is question of life and death.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>9. We feel safe with "their" people</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						When our lives are "right" people, we are ready to give them itself completely. We become faithful soldiers, ready to fight for our loved ones. Just ask our friends. In the company we flowering and shining. We need time to find the "right" people, but then we never refuse from them.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>10. We have friends who really love us</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						Introverts need other people and other people also needed introverts. Most of us are not experiencing problems with communication. We, like everyone else, sometimes walking in bars, at parties, get to know new people. The difference is that not all whom we meet, become our friends. We consciously choose one allow to approach of close friends and thoroughly working relationship.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>11. We can temporarily pretend himself extroverts</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						We have to do this for survive. We can be a star of party, organizers of major corporate events or heads of charities. We do so willingly, knowing that at the end of the day we can go home. When we get there, sometimes we have to spend on recovery days and even weeks.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>12. We are not shy, not rude and not very nervous</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						At first it may seem that it is. But if you get to know us closer, we realize that we may amuse you and talked with you more than fifteen minutes. We just are not with all. Sociability for us - this is an option that is not included as standard. We can not simulate happiness or emotional arousal.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>13. We are well alone</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						In our minds there is a lot of things, and we do not need more. In contrast to extroverts, we do not need the presence of others for external stimulation. Life in our inner world completely satisfied us. We entertain ourselves creative projects and well spend time perfectly.
						</p>
						<h3>
						<strong>14. We hate secular chatter</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						We are thinkers, and we give pleasure talking about great ideas, theories and ideals. We rarely take part in small talk and do it reluctantly.
						</p> 
						<h3>
						<strong>15. If we chose you - appreciate it</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
						We appreciate the time spend alone and very thoroughly treat those who admit in our lives. Communication with the "wrong" person will be squeeze us emotionally. We often look for like-minded introverts, but also properly communicate with the extroverts. And especially valuable for us is the time spent with the other introverts in a company where people have an excellent understanding of the limits of personal space.
