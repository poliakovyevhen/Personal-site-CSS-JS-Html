						<h2>Many cases, and not enough time - what to do?</h2>
						<p>
						One of the things that frustrates many of us - that we most do so much, but this time seems to be not enough. We feel overload. Of course, "not enough time" - just a feeling. The time each of us the same number, but we often hammered our days a very large number of cases and classes.
						</p>
						<p>
						The problem is that we put too many things in a small container (24 hours). If we look at the time and task management just as the internal organization of container, everything becomes easier. So how squeeze all that we have to do in this little box? It should be <strong>simplified.</strong> And say <strong>goodbye</strong>. I guarantee: These two steps will allow you to deal with the problem when the cases are very much, and very little time.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Simplify tasks
						</h3>
						<p>
						If you realize that we are trying to fit too much (business, routine tasks, obligations) in a small container (24 hours) will become clear that more container volume can not be obtained. So you need to get rid of some cases. They still do not fit. You need to simplify all that we need to do.
						</p>
						<p>
						Try to pay attention to what you do today and tomorrow to mark everything that you try to fit in a box of its day. What sites you go in the morning? And in the evening? In which games you playing on your phone? What read? How much time spend on email, Facebook, Twitter, Instahrami? How many in blogs, online stores on Youtube? How watch TV? How much spent on cleaning, personal hygiene, care about others? How long travel to work? What is a valuable resource for your attention?
						</p>
						<p>
						At this point you may realize that putting in a box too much garbage. Throw away the part. Prevent yourself go to certain websites and applications until make at least some really important things. Now look at your to-do list, how many of them you can actually do today? In my opinion, three.
						</p>
						<h3>
						Art farewell
						</h3>
						<p>
						But what matters from what you want to do (or think you need to do)? What if they do not fit in your box? Here is useful arts goodbye. Too many things you want to stuff in your container but you have already decided that there will only shove the most important and most beautiful. This means that some of the things you supposedly would do not fit. You can take them for later. Or not taken. In any case, now they do not fit anywhere.
						</p>
						<p>
						Believe me, this is not a problem. This becomes a problem when you're worried that you can not just make it. Your disorder arises from an ideal notion that you should be able to catch it, delete it from the list. And even more: you want to travel, exercise, meditate, learn new skills, read more, be the perfect man (or find a) be a perfect parent, friend, brother or sister, draw, write music and so on.
						</p>
						<p>
						However, this ideal does not match reality. The reality is that you can not do it all today or even this week. You can choose some of these activities, but others will have to wait or even be crossed.<strong> Find more time is impossible.</strong> You can only adjust your ideals.
