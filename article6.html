						<h2>Does humor makes life easier?</h2>
						<p>
						They say if you can laugh at something you can live with it. Is this true? If the ability to see the funny side of things acts as a shield against psychological stress? Several new studies published in the<strong> Journal of Personality and Social Psychological Bulletin,</strong> argues in support of this idea. But they also show why it is so difficult to understand whether humor reduces stress or just easier to look at things with a laugh, if you cope well with difficulties. In addition, if the psychological studies actually find out that humor protects against stress, and this is a big question, there is a serious risk that people who suffer from stress, succumb to social pressure should laugh more, and it only exacerbate their suffering.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Heidi Fritz</strong> with <strong>Clarkson University</strong> and her colleagues began the study, which was attended by 21 women and 1 man with chronic fibromyalgia syndrome. Participants initially completed a basic questionnaire about their physical health, psychological state, tendency to look at things with humor (for example, they were asked if they cheer when they shed waiter drink), how much they communicate with friends and family lately and how they tend to overestimate the problem and look for the positive side in a difficult situation. The next four days, participants completed daily diaries of their physical and emotional state.
						</p>
						<p>
						Participants who talked about the good humor in the beginning, experienced less psychological discomfort at baseline and during their diary under physical symptoms were the best. But contrary to the expectations of researchers, the advantage is not sense of humor because it helps to reassess the situation or improve relationships with people.
						</p>
						<p>
						The second study involved more than 100 senior students who answered questions about their psychological and emotional state, and the inclination to look at things with humor and joke, and mentioned disturbing events from the past and how they continue to influence them.
						</p>
						<p>
						In general, more of the students said that injuries the past continues to influence them, the higher the assessed their symptoms of psychological stress. But most importantly, it is not concerned students who were exposed to humor and could see the funny side of things - they argued that the injury still affects their lives, but judging by the emotional indicators have not experienced increased stress.
						</p>
						<p>
						The obvious problem of these two studies is that less frustrated participants could be just more fun. Then we can assume that their penchant for humor served as a factor that reduces the level of stress or, as in the first study, the physical symptoms.
						</p>
						<p>
						The latest study was an attempt to overcome this problem by employing students affected by the September 11 attacks in New York. Students rated their basic psychological indicators of a month after the attacks, including an assessment of attitudes to humor (and style of jokes), and then two months later they answered more questions about the levels of psychological stress.
						</p>
						<p>
						The researchers found a trend: humor, which supports the (positive outlook on life) associated with a decrease in stress over time and with a high propensity to reassess situations - finding positive aspects where possible. Self-destructive humor (degrading), by contrast, was associated with high stress and lower revaluation.
						</p>
						<p>
						Fritz and colleagues talk about the patterns that are observed in their studies, "the benefits of humor may reduce psychological stress in response to intense events." But look weak evidence: in a recent study used the methodology necessary for determining the potential role of humor in reducing suffering, and statistically it was found that a strong propensity for humor at baseline directly linked to less stress at follow-up (and even if this were so, it is still possible that some other unknown variable, for example, certain traits is the real reason for the greater propensity to humor and less concern. to beat w conclusive evidence of the impact of humor on stress requires an experiment where people manipulate a sense of humor and observe its effects on stress - just not an easy task).
						</p>
						<p>
						"Given the firm conviction of the benefits of humor for physical health, it is important to understand the scale of its impact," - concluded the researchers. And this requires a full investigation.
